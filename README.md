## Janelia Cosem Data Retrieval

This repository contains test codes to retrieve data from the Janelia Cosem data stores.
One of the ways to retreive and analyze data is by using the 3D visualization tool ParaView.
`janelia.py` is a ParaView python plugin that accepts a data url and a data array from a `N5` store
to fetch data into paraview and visualize it.
